A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element.
    5.When do we need to use class based components instead of functional components
Because they're lightweight, writing these simple components as functional components is pretty standard.
If the components need more functionality, like keeping state, use classes instead.
    6.What is the use cases of class based component ?
Class-based components are slightly slower than their functional counterparts. The difference is very small and is almost negligible for smaller web apps â€“ 
though the performance difference increases when the number of components in the app increases. 
    7.Which type of component do use most frequently ? functional or class-based component
