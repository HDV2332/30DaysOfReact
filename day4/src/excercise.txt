1.What is the difference between a regular function and an arrow function?
this value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on the invocation. 
But this inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to this of the outer function.
arguments object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments. 
The arrow function, on the opposite, doesn't define arguments (but you can easily access the arrow function arguments using a rest parameter ...args).
If the arrow function has one expression, then the expression is returned implicitly, even without using the return keyword.
