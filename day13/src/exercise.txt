    1.What is a controlled input?
an input that gets its value from a single source of truth.

    2.What is an uncontrolled input
an input that gets its value from input fields like traditional HTML form data handling.

    3.How do you get a content of a certain HTML element in React ?
use ref
<input id='firstName' name='firstName' ref={this.firstName}/>

    4.Why it is not a good idea to touch the DOM directly in React ?
because performing certain operations can be very slow/costly depending on how you do them depends on where/when you target the DOM.
"When you touch the DOM in any way, you set a dirty bit on the whole tree that tells the browser it needs to figure 
out where everything goes again. 
When JS hands control back to the browser, it invokes its layout algorithm (or more technically, 
it invokes its CSS recalc algorithm, then layout, then repaint, then re-compositing) to redraw the screen."

    5.What is most frequently used in React ? Controlled or Uncontrolled input.
Controlled.

    6.What do you need to write uncontrolled input?
instead of writing an event handler for every state update, you can use a ref to get form values from the DOM.

    7.Does state require to write uncontrolled input?
No

    8.When do you use uncontrolled input?
Since an uncontrolled component keeps the source of truth in the DOM, it is sometimes easier to integrate React and non-React code when using uncontrolled components. 
It can also be slightly less code if you want to be quick and dirty.

    9.When do you use controlled input?
you should usually use controlled components.

    10.Do you use a controlled or uncontrolled input to validate form input fields?
either will do.
