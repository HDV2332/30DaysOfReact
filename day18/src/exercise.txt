    1.What is HTTP request?
An HTTP request is made by a client, to a named host, which is located on a server. 
The aim of the request is to access a resource on the server. 
To make the request, the client uses components of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), 
which includes the information needed to access the resource.

    2.What are the most common HTTP requests?
GET and POST.

    3.What is fetch?
The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network).

Axios is a third party package and it is the most popular way to make HTTP requests(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
    
    5.What is the difference between fetch and axios?
- Fetch's body = Axios' data

the url as parameter.

when status is 200 and statusText is 'OK'
- To get the json object response: in fetch call the json() function on the response object, 
in Axios get data property of the response object.
